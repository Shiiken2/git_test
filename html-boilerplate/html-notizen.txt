  <h2>Basic Concepts</h2>
    <h3>Tags and Elements</h3>
    <p>Tags are surrounding the Elements</p>
    <p>Elements are containers for content. Using elements correctly is called semantic HTML.</p>
    <h3>Void Elements</h3>
    <p>Void Elements like br or img do not have a closing tag. They are void because they dont wrap any content.</p>

html files are by default called index.html. web servers will look for files by that name

Full Boilerplate contains:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
     <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8>
        <title>My First Webpage</title>
    </head>

    <body>
        <p>
            
        </p>
    </body>
</html>
